# Surface area of a cone
# Find the surface area of a cone given the height and the radius.
# You will need to ask the user to enter in both variables, and will 
# need to use the Pythagorean relationship to find the slant height. 
# (2 points)
#
# Inputs:
# height, radius
#
# Outputs:
# surface area
#
# Test output
# r = 3
# h = 5
# sa = 83.2297607912

r = 3
s = 5
pi = 3.14

sa = pi*r*s + pi*r**2

print(f" the surface area of the cone is {sa}")
